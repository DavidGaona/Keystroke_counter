# Keystroke Counter

A simple standalone app to count your keystroke distribution, to help you find a better layout for your keyboard or to 
create your own keyboard. The idea is to make this useful enough for it to be a benchmark of keyboard layout quality.

Future plans:
- Add proper bigram visualization
- Discriminate by application focus <--- currently working on
- Add more statistics and make a better analysis
- Improve UI
- Add linux support
- Add macos support
